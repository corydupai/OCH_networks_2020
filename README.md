# OCH_networks_2020
Repository for Open Coding Hour network visualization demo for 10.28.2020

This is a basic overview of working with and visualizing network/graph data in R with a focus on biological data.

# What's in the repo
Files are as follows:

- network_vis.Rmd : has all of the code we're going to work through together
- network_vis.html : knit version of the above, has code and graphical output.
- data/VPI1_VPI2.csv : expression data for Vibrio cholerae, mostly from vibrio pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (hence the name)
